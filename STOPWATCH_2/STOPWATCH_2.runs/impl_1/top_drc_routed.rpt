2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net deboun/div/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin deboun/div/debounce_q[9]_i_3/O, cell deboun/div/debounce_q[9]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net deboun/div/d_diff is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin deboun/div/last_state_i_2__1/O, cell deboun/div/last_state_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net disp/div/d_diff is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin disp/div/last_state_i_2/O, cell disp/div/last_state_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net disp/div/mux_clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin disp/div/FSM_sequential_an_state[1]_i_2/O, cell disp/div/FSM_sequential_an_state[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sw/div/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sw/div/millis_01[3]_i_2/O, cell sw/div/millis_01[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sw/div/d_diff is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sw/div/last_state_i_2__0/O, cell sw/div/last_state_i_2__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>
