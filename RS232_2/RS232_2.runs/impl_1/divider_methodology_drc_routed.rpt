TIMING-17#9 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin o_state_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell d_pq[3]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) d_nq_reg[0]/CLR, d_nq_reg[1]/CLR, d_nq_reg[2]/CLR, d_nq_reg[3]/CLR,
d_pq_reg[0]/CLR, d_pq_reg[1]/CLR, d_pq_reg[2]/CLR, d_pq_reg[3]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
